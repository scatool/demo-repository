# demo-repository
This is the repository used as a demo-project in SCA-Tool.

# Why SCA-Tool?
SCA Tool provides everything you need for this:

SBOM management (what third-party code is in my software?)
Open source governance (can I use this open source code?)
License compliance (how do I comply with open source licenses?)
Vulnerability management (are there security risks in my code?)
